## Dan Dunford

My passion of self-led learning ignited in 2018, upon completing a remote full-time Psychology Degree. This passion to learn keeps me focused and resilient, skills I intend to utilise and evolve with a career in Software Development.

My first exposure to careers in Tech came via my role as a Software Development Recruitment Consultant in 2019. Whilst recruitment was not for me, the constantly evolving Software Development industry intrigued me and led to insightful conversations with Makers graduates.

Fast forward to today, I am currently studying coding at the highly-regarded Makers Academy Bootcamp and hope to be part of some exciting and innovative tech for good in the near future.
